# AI-Exercises
A collection of exercises and assignments revolving around AI programming such as heuristics, constraints, LLMs etc. There are more detailed files in the assignment files themselves, including the nature of the exercises we worked on + the coding we had to do in order to complete the exercises. Because the class was so AI-focused, these exercises served to help me understand how to learn these complicated concepts. I decided to store them here for future use and so that a reference point can exist should I decide to implement similar concepts in personal projects. Following below are brief descriptions of the assignments (sans A1 due to corrupted files) and what concepts they covered.\
